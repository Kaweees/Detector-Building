# Detector-Building
#### Arduino Examples
In this repository, you will find example Arduino code you can compile and flash to your NinjaPi Crust or BeagleBone Cape. For instructions on how to flash your cape/crust, click here. If you don't want to compile each example, there is a precompiled hex in each example for your convenience.

Enjoy!
